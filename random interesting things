Hmm, so I stumbled across some archived discussions from the net.jokes newsgroup that was buzzing in the early 1980s. Honestly, it’s wild seeing what people thought was “prime internet humor” back then — everything from groan-worthy puns to obscure cipher puzzles hidden in plain text.

The coolest part? You can tell this was one of the first places where online culture started to form. People weren’t just trading jokes; they were experimenting with text tricks, simple encodings, and leaving little challenges for others to solve.

It’s kind of surreal: imagine being one of the few folks online in those days, posting jokes to a handful of readers scattered across universities, not realizing you were helping to shape the DNA of internet communities we take for granted now.

Made me think… how many of today’s memes and “inside jokes” will look just as quaint in another 60 years? 🤔

Anyone else here ever dig into old Usenet archives for fun?
